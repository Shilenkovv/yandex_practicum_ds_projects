## List of projects

 â„– | Project | Description | Stack
--- | --- | --- | ---
13 | [Telecom churn prediction](https://github.com/Shilenkovv/yandex_ds_projects/tree/main/13_telecom_churn_prediction) | The telecommunications operator wants to combat customer churn. To do this, its employees will start offering promo codes and special conditions to anyone planning to cancel their communication services. In order to proactively identify such users, the operator needs a model that will predict whether a subscriber will terminate their contract. | *Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Sklearn, Phik, Shap, CatBoost, LightGBM*
12 | [Computer Vision: Age Recognition](https://github.com/Shilenkovv/yandex_ds_projects/tree/main/12_age_prediction)  | Build a model that will determine the approximate age of a person from a photograph. There is a set of photographs of people showing age. | *Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tensorflow*
11 | [Natural Language Processing: Classifying Comments](https://github.com/Shilenkovv/yandex_ds_projects/tree/main/11_toxic_comments_classification) | The online store "Wikishop" is launching a new service. Now users can edit and add to product descriptions, just like in wiki communities. This means that customers can suggest their edits and comment on the changes made by others. The store needs a tool that will detect toxic comments and send them for moderation. | *Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud, NLTK, TfidfVectorizer, Sklearn, Transformers*
10 | [Predicting the Number of Taxi Orders](https://github.com/Shilenkovv/yandex_ds_projects/tree/main/10_taxi_order_prediction) | Train a model to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour. | *Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Catboost, LightGBM*
09 | [Car Price Prediction Model](https://github.com/Shilenkovv/yandex_ds_projects/tree/main/09_car_prices_prediction) | Train the model to determine the market value of the car. | *Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Time, Sklearn, Catboost, LightGBM*
08 | [Personal Data Protection](https://github.com/Shilenkovv/yandex_ds_projects/tree/main/08_personal_data_protection) | The method of data transformation to protect the personal information of the clients of the insurance company. | *Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Sklearn*
07 | [Gold Recovery prediction](https://github.com/Shilenkovv/yandex_ds_projects/tree/main/07_gold_recovery) | Development of a model predicting the recovery rate of gold from gold ore. | *Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Catboost*
06 | [Choosing a Region for the Development of New Oil Fields](https://github.com/Shilenkovv/yandex_ds_projects/tree/main/06_machine_learning_in_business) | Decide in which region to extract oil. Build a machine learning model that will help determine the region where mining will bring the most profit with the least risk of loss. | *Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Phik, Sklearn, Bootstrap*
05 | [Bank Customer Churn Modeling](https://github.com/Shilenkovv/yandex_ds_projects/tree/main/05_supervised_learning) | From "Beta Bank" clients started leaving. Every month. Not a lot, but noticeable. Bank marketers calculated that it's cheaper to retain current clients than to attract new ones. It is necessary to forecast whether a client will leave the bank in the near future or not. | *Pandas, Matplotlib, Phik, Imblearn, Sklearn, Catboost*
04 | [Building a Model to Determine a Suitable Tariff for Telecom](https://github.com/Shilenkovv/yandex_ds_projects/tree/main/04_introduction_to_machine_learning) | Operator of mobile communication has found out: many clients are using legacy tariffs. They want to build a system capable of analyzing customer behavior and offering users a new tariff. | *Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Sklearn*
03 | [Gamedev: Studying the Patterns That Determine the Success of Games](https://github.com/Shilenkovv/yandex_ds_projects/tree/main/03_game_sales_data_research) | Using historical data on sales of computer games, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms, identify patterns that determine the success of a game. | *Pandas, Numpy, SciPy, Matplotlib*
02 | [Telecom Company: Statistical Data Analysis, Determination of a Favorable Tariff](https://github.com/Shilenkovv/yandex_ds_projects/tree/main/02_statistical_data_analysis) | Based on the data of the mobile operator's customers, analyze customer behavior and find the optimal tariff. | *Pandas, Numpy, Math, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn*
01 | [Real Estate Market Analysis: Apartments For Sale in St. Petersburg](https://github.com/Shilenkovv/yandex_ds_projects/tree/main/01_EDA) | Based on data from the Yandex.Real estate service, the market value of real estate objects and typical parameters of apartments were determined. | *Pandas, Matplotlib*
